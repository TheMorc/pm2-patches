# Patchmanager 2 compatible patches for SFOS

Just a bunch of patches that I made over the time that I had Sailfish OS on my hands.

## Basic packaging
* Usually packaged by opening the folder with the patch and just compressing the contents.
* Obviously followed by uploading the patch to [the web catalog](https://coderus.openrepos.net/pm2/)

## Installation
Since all patches are distributed using [the web catalog](https://coderus.openrepos.net/pm2/projects/Morc), just use the settings page in system settings for installing them.
